# Optimize-hyperparameters-for-a-neural-network-model

**Aim:**

Optimize hyperparameters for a neural network model. Implement a hyperparameter optimization strategy and compare the performance with different hyperparameter configurations for both classification and regression tasks.

**Theory: **

Hyperparameters are the variables that determine the network structure (Eg: Number of Hidden Units) and the variables that determine how the network is trained (Eg: Learning Rate). Hyperparameters are set before training (before optimizing the weights and bias).

Hyperparameter related to Neural Networks: 

1) Number of Hidden layers 
  •	Many hidden units within a layer with regularization techniques can increase accuracy. 
    A smaller number of units may cause underfitting.
   
3) Dropout
  •	It is a regularization technique to avoid overfitting thus increasing the generalizing power.
  •	Generally, use a small dropout value of 20%-50% of neurons with 20% providing a good starting point. 
  •	A probability too low has minimal effect and a value too high results in under-learning by the network. 
  •	You are likely to get better performance when dropout is used on a larger network, giving the model more of an opportunity to learn independent representations. Learning The Hyperparameters 

4) Network Weight Initialization 
  •	Ideally, it may be better to use different weight initialization schemes according to the activation function used on each layer. 

5) Activation Function 
  •	Activation functions are used to introduce nonlinearity to models, which allows deep learning models to learn nonlinear prediction boundaries. 
  •	Generally, the rectifier activation function  (ReLU) is the most popular. 
  •	Sigmoid is used in the output layer while making binary predictions. 
  •	Softmax is used in the output layer while making multi-class predictions.

Methods used to find out hyperparameters 
1) Manual Search 
2) Grid Search 
3) Random Search 
4) Bayesian Optimization


**Conclusion:**

Random search efficiently optimizes hyperparameters for neural network models in classification and regression tasks, offering competitive performance with less computational overhead compared to grid search.
